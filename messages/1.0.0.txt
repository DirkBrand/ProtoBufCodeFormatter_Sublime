Protocol Buffer Code Formatter v1.0.0 Changelog:

Features:
-         Click save to correctly format your code.

Limitations:
- Variable indentation length

- Formatter cannot preserve order of structures

- For comments, outer `extend' groups are logically grouped together, so inner comments are lost

- Style of comments are not preserved (/* */ vs. //), so single-line comments are shown with `//` and multi-line comments with `/* */`.

- Any comments not directly adjacent to a line of code, are not preserved.  Comments must be directly above or below a line of code (without newlines).

- If an error occurs, please review the Sublime console: ctrl + `
